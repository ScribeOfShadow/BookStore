  ## Transparency and Known Issues

In our commitment to transparency and open communication, we want to highlight some challenges and limitations encountered during the development of the Verulam High Library and Bookstore System. We believe in honesty about our system's current state and our ongoing efforts to improve it.

### Challenges Faced:

- **Cash On Delivery (COD) Payment Method**: To meet project deadlines, the COD payment method was hardcoded into the system. This was a necessary step to ensure functionality but does limit flexibility in payment processing.

- **Analytics Functionality**: The analytics feature was also hardcoded due to time constraints and technical hurdles. As a result, it may not offer the full depth of insights typically expected from a fully integrated analytics solution.

- **Product Rating Scale**: Implementing a proper rating scale for products proved challenging within the project's timeframe. Consequently, this feature may not fully meet user expectations for providing feedback on products.

- **Email Service Interruption**: Changes in Google's permission settings have impacted our email service, preventing it from functioning as originally designed. We are actively seeking alternative solutions to restore this critical communication feature.

### Current Limitations:

- **Coupons Application**: Currently, coupons cannot be applied within the system due to unresolved technical issues. This is a feature we are prioritizing for future updates.

- **Adding Products to Wishlist**: Users may experience difficulties when attempting to add products to their wishlist. This functionality is not working as intended, and we are working diligently to address this problem.

### Moving Forward:

We are fully committed to addressing these challenges and improving the system's overall functionality. Our team is exploring all available options to resolve these issues promptly and efficiently. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we work towards making the Verulam High Library and Bookstore System better for all users.

### Feedback and Contributions:

Your feedback is invaluable to us. If you have suggestions for overcoming these challenges or wish to contribute to the project, please feel free to reach out or submit a pull request. Together, we can enhance the system's capabilities and provide a more robust solution for our users.
