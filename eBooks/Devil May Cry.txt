He’s a red coat wearing, demon form bearing, gun-wielding, death-dealing, rocket riding, high flying, son of a gun. Or that’s what he would be if he was described by Ric Flair (WHOO!).He’s actually a son of Sparda, the Legendary Dark Knight who, in the war between the human and the demon worlds went against his own kind to aid the humans. After defeating the demon king Mundus, Sparda closed the gateway connecting the human world to the demon one using his own blood, a special amulet, and the blood of a human priestess. For a while, everything was great: Sparda was a benevolent ruler for about 2,000 years, gained a human form and fell in love with a woman named Eva. The two had twin boys, Dante and Vergil, who he gave each a half of his special amulet.Sadly, at some point (we don’t exactly know when or how) Sparda dies, and this is where things start to take a turn. Mundus’s demons return to the human world and kills Eva, leaving Sparda’s two sons orphaned and alone.
